# Roadmap

AgentEval is actively developed. This page outlines completed features and what's coming next.

## Current Status: v0.2.0-beta

AgentEval is in **beta** with all core features complete and ready for production use.

## What's Shipped

### Core Evaluation
- **evaluation harness** for AI agents (`MAFEvaluationHarness`, `IEvaluationHarness`)
- **Fluent assertions** for tool usage, performance, and responses
- **stochastic evaluation** - run N times, assert on pass rates
- **Model comparison** with statistical significance
- **Multi-turn conversation evaluation** (`ConversationRunner`)
- **Multi-agent workflow evaluation** - comprehensive pipeline evaluation with MAF integration
  - Sequential and parallel workflow orchestration
  - Per-executor performance analysis and assertions
  - Workflow graph structure validation and visualization
  - Tool chain coordination across multiple agents
  - Event streaming and timeout handling
  - `WorkflowResultAssertions` with hierarchical validation
- **Snapshot evaluation** for regression detection

### Metrics & Evaluation
- **RAG metrics:** Faithfulness, Relevance, Context Precision/Recall, Answer Correctness
- **Agentic metrics:** Tool Selection, Tool Arguments, Tool Success, Task Completion, Efficiency
- **Workflow metrics:** Structure validity, execution order, executor success, tool chain validation, output quality
- **Embedding-based similarity** metrics
- **Calibrated judges** with confidence intervals and voting strategies

### Performance & Observability
- **Streaming support** with real-time callbacks
- **Time to First Token (TTFT)** tracking
- **Per-tool timing** and execution waterfall
- **Token counting and cost estimation** (8+ models)
- **Performance benchmarks** (latency, throughput, cost)
- **Workflow performance benchmarks** - end-to-end latency, per-executor analysis, scaling characteristics, quality vs performance trade-offs
- **Trace record/replay** - capture and reproduce executions deterministically

### Behavioral Policies
- `NeverCallTool()` - forbid specific tool calls
- `NeverPassArgumentMatching()` - forbid argument patterns (PII, etc.)
- `MustConfirmBefore()` - require confirmation before sensitive operations

### CI/CD Integration
- **CLI tool** (`agenteval eval`, `agenteval init`, `agenteval list`)
- **Workflow CLI commands** (`agenteval workflow-eval`, `workflow-init`, `workflow-validate`)
- **Result exporters:** JSON, JUnit XML, Markdown, TRX, Mermaid (workflow graphs)
- **Dataset loaders:** JSON, JSONL, CSV, YAML (including workflow test cases)
- **Rich test output** with verbosity levels and trace artifacts

### Framework Support
- **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)** adapter with comprehensive workflow support
  - `MAFWorkflowAdapter` for multi-agent pipeline evaluation
  - `MAFWorkflowEventBridge` for event processing and timeout handling
  - Native MAF `WorkflowBuilder` integration with `BindAsExecutor`
- **Generic `IChatClient`** adapter
- **Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation** integration

## What's Next

We're focused on making AgentEval the most comprehensive evaluation toolkit for AI agents in .NET. Upcoming areas include:

- **CLI enhancements** - summary views, diff comparisons, visualization
- **Additional framework adapters** - Semantic Kernel, LangChain.NET
- **Visual reporting** - HTML reports, interactive diagrams
- **Experiment management** - A/B evaluation, baseline comparison
- **Safety evaluation** - red-teaming, adversarial inputs
