|--------|-------------------|------|----------|
| `llm_` | LLM-as-judge evaluation | $$ (API calls) | Detailed quality analysis, production sampling |
| `code_` | Computed by code logic | Free | CI/CD, unit tests, high-volume testing |
| `embed_` | Embedding similarity | $ (embedding API) | Cost-effective semantic checks |
